# Unismot
This repository contains the code and dataset for the Unismot project, which is based on our paper:

**[UniRTL: A universal RGBT and low-light benchmark for object tracking]**

We are in the process of cleaning up the code and preparing the dataset for release. Both will be open-sourced soon. Stay tuned for updates!
